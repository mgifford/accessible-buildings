# Sensory Trust – The Access Chain

## Purpose of This Canonical Summary

This document preserves and operationalizes the **Access Chain** model as described by Sensory Trust.

The Access Chain is a conceptual framework for understanding accessibility as a sequence of linked stages. If one link fails, the overall experience fails.

This summary:

- Extracts the structural logic of the Access Chain.
- Generalizes it beyond visitor attractions.
- Maps it directly to this toolkit’s templates and maintenance framework.
- Does not reproduce copyrighted text.

# Core Concept

Accessibility is not a single feature.  
It is a sequence of dependent conditions.

If any one stage is inaccessible, the entire experience is inaccessible.

Example:
A building may have an accessible toilet.
If the lift to reach it is broken, access fails.
If the accessible entrance is locked, access fails.
If staff do not know how to assist, access fails.

Accessibility must be understood as a system.

---

# Standard Access Chain Stages

The Access Chain typically includes:

1. Pre-visit information
2. Journey planning
3. Arrival
4. Parking / drop-off
5. Entrance
6. Horizontal circulation
7. Vertical circulation
8. Participation
9. Facilities use
10. Exit

Some Sensory Trust publications group stages differently, but the underlying structure is sequential and cumulative.

# Stage-by-Stage Structural Translation

## 1. Pre-Visit Information

Failure risks:
- No access information online.
- PDF-only access guide.
- Vague claims (“fully accessible”).
- No contact for questions.

Toolkit implications:
- HTML-first Building Access Guide required.
- Clear contact for access queries.
- Explicit constraints listed.
- Linked from footer and contact page.

---

## 2. Journey Planning

Failure risks:
- No public transport guidance.
- No taxi drop-off description.
- No cycling information.
- No accessible parking information.
- No surface or gradient description.

Toolkit implications:
- Arrival template must describe each mode.
- Distances in meters.
- Known crossing hazards.
- Surface types.
- Alternate routes.

---

## 3. Arrival and Approach

Failure risks:
- Snow or debris blocking route.
- Outdoor furniture blocking path.
- Gate locked.
- Poor signage to alternate entrance.

Toolkit implications:
- Maintenance checklist must include route inspection.
- Access guide must specify entrance used.
- If alternate entrance required, instructions must be precise.

---

## 4. Entrance

Failure risks:
- Step at threshold.
- Heavy manual doors.
- Powered doors turned off.
- Intercom inaccessible.
- Security procedures unclear.

Toolkit implications:
- Door type must be specified.
- Failure protocol must be stated.
- Assistance request method must be clear.

---

## 5. Internal Circulation (Horizontal)

Failure risks:
- Narrow routes.
- Temporary exhibits blocking access.
- Stanchions reducing clearance.
- Protruding objects in cane-detectable zone.
- Poor signage.

Toolkit implications:
- Route width must be maintained.
- Temporary reconfigurations must consider access.
- Signage must include accessible route indicators.

---

## 6. Vertical Circulation

Failure risks:
- Lift out of service.
- No signage to alternative lift.
- Lift requires staff escort.
- Only stair access to key area.

Toolkit implications:
- Lift-dependent areas must be disclosed.
- Outage communication plan required.
- Alternative content delivery should be considered.

---

## 7. Participation

Failure risks:
- Assistive listening devices not working.
- No captioning.
- No tactile access.
- Staff unaware of accommodations.

Toolkit implications:
- Program accessibility must be described.
- Equipment testing must be scheduled.
- Staff training required.

---

## 8. Facilities

Failure risks:
- Accessible toilet used for storage.
- Changing Places locked.
- Counters blocked.
- Shop aisles narrowed by merchandise.

Toolkit implications:
- Facilities must be included in access description.
- Retail areas must not be excluded from access planning.
- Maintenance checklist must include storage monitoring.

---

## 9. Exit

Failure risks:
- Emergency egress not accessible.
- Accessible exit not signed.
- Route blocked during events.

Toolkit implications:
- Exit routes must be considered in maintenance review.
- Emergency procedures must include disabled visitors.

---

# Systemic Insight

The Access Chain demonstrates:

Accessibility is cumulative.  
Accessibility is fragile.  
Accessibility requires coordination across departments.

Infrastructure alone does not create accessibility.

---

# Relationship to This Toolkit

The Access Chain model directly informs:

- `/access-chain.md`
- `/templates/building-access-guide.md`
- `/templates/arrival-template.md`
- `/templates/maintenance-checklist.md`
- `/governance.md`

All templates must map to specific Access Chain stages.

No section of the Access Chain may be omitted without explanation.

---

# What Has Been Omitted

This summary does not reproduce:

- Full narrative text from Sensory Trust.
- Case studies.
- Training program details.
- Images or diagrams.

It preserves the structural model only.

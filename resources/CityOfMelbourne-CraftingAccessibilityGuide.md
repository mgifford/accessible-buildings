# City of Melbourne – Crafting an Accessibility Guide

## Purpose of This Canonical Summary

This document preserves and operationalizes the structural guidance published by the City of Melbourne on crafting an accessibility guide for venues and public-facing buildings.

The City of Melbourne guidance is practical and audience-focused. It emphasizes:

- Clarity over compliance language
- Real-world detail over generic claims
- Visitor usability over legal positioning

This summary extracts the structural publishing principles and translates them into toolkit-ready implementation requirements.

It does not reproduce the original content verbatim.

# Core Contribution

The City of Melbourne guidance addresses a common failure:

Organizations claim accessibility but do not describe it in a way that helps someone plan a visit.

Its approach emphasizes:

- Writing from the perspective of a visitor with disability.
- Describing the physical journey step-by-step.
- Including practical detail, not just feature lists.
- Being transparent about limitations.

This aligns directly with the Access Chain model.

---

# Structural Publishing Principles

## 1. Write for Decision-Making, Not Compliance

The guide should help someone answer:

- Can I get there independently?
- Will I need assistance?
- What barriers might I encounter?
- Should I contact the venue in advance?

Avoid:
- “Fully accessible”
- “Wheelchair friendly”
- “Compliant with standards”

Instead provide:
- Specific details
- Physical descriptions
- Measurable conditions where possible

Toolkit Implication:

All templates must prohibit vague compliance claims without explanation.

---

## 2. Describe the Physical Journey Sequentially

The City of Melbourne model implicitly follows a journey structure:

1. Getting to the venue
2. Approaching the entrance
3. Entering
4. Moving through the space
5. Using facilities
6. Participating in activities

This mirrors the Access Chain.

Toolkit Implication:

Templates must be organized in this order.

Content must not jump directly to toilets or hearing loops without describing arrival.

---

## 3. Include Physical Detail That People Actually Use

The guidance emphasizes practical environmental detail, such as:

- Surfaces (gravel, carpet, tile)
- Slopes and ramps
- Door weight
- Lighting conditions
- Noise levels
- Seating availability
- Space to maneuver

Toolkit Expansion:

Templates must include prompts for:

- Surface type
- Gradient presence
- Automatic vs manual doors
- Lighting level and glare
- Busy times
- Rest areas

Not all venues will have all information. Unknown conditions must be marked as “unknown.”

---

## 4. Acknowledge Limitations Clearly

The City of Melbourne guidance stresses transparency.

Visitors prefer:
- Honest disclosure of barriers
- Workarounds described
- Advance notice if required

Rather than:
- Overly optimistic descriptions
- Omission of constraints

Toolkit Requirement:

Every Building Access Guide must include a:

## “What Is Not Accessible” section

This section must:
- List known barriers.
- Describe temporary barriers if common.
- Offer alternatives if available.

---

## 5. Use Plain Language

The guidance emphasizes:

- Short sentences
- Clear headings
- Avoiding technical jargon
- Avoiding regulatory citations in visitor-facing copy

Toolkit Requirement:

Templates must:
- Use direct, task-based headings.
- Avoid legal language in visitor-facing sections.
- Separate legal context (if any) from practical guidance.

---

## 6. Keep Information Current

Accessibility guides must reflect current conditions.

Risks include:
- Renovations
- Temporary exhibitions
- Furniture reconfiguration
- Seasonal conditions
- Service outages

Toolkit Governance Implication:

- Include a “Last Updated” date.
- Include review triggers (renovation, layout change, new event).
- Assign responsibility to a named role.

---

## 7. Consider Multiple Disabilities

The City of Melbourne guidance expands accessibility beyond mobility:

- Low vision
- Blindness
- Hearing loss
- Sensory sensitivities
- Neurodivergence
- Cognitive disability

Toolkit Implication:

Templates must include:

- Sensory profile section
- Lighting description
- Sound environment description
- Quiet space availability
- Hearing loop availability
- Visual contrast or wayfinding clarity

Accessibility guides must not focus exclusively on wheelchair users.

---

# Differences from Other Canonical Resources

Compared to:

## DOJ 2009
The City of Melbourne guidance is:
- Less compliance-focused
- More visitor-oriented
- Less technical
- More descriptive

## Sensory Trust Access Chain
City of Melbourne:
- Applies the access chain implicitly
- Focuses on plain-language description
- Emphasizes environmental detail

## Australian Government Building Accessibility Guide
City of Melbourne:
- More narrative
- Less bureaucratic
- More human-centered

This makes it valuable as a usability lens.

# Operational Translation for This Toolkit

This canonical resource directly informs:

- `/templates/building-access-guide.md`
- `/templates/sensory-profile.md`
- `/templates/arrival-template.md`
- `/website-placement.md`
- `/governance.md`

Specifically, it reinforces:

- Transparency requirement
- Plain-language requirement
- Sensory environment disclosure
- Limitation disclosure
- Visitor decision support

---

# What Has Been Omitted

This summary does not reproduce:

- Full narrative examples
- Case studies
- Visual examples
- Legal references
- Complete text

It preserves the structural publishing model and usability philosophy.

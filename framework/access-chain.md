# The Access Chain Model

Accessibility is not a binary state ("accessible" vs. "inaccessible"). It is a sequence of events. We call this the **Access Chain**.

If any single link in this chain breaks, the visitor may be unable to complete their visit.

## The Sequence

### 1. Planning
The journey begins before the visitor leaves home.
- **Failures:** Missing information, PDF-only guides, vague language ("fully accessible"), hidden links.
- **Goal:** Provide enough detail for a visitor to decide: "Yes, I can do this."

### 2. Travel
Getting to the vicinity of the building.
- **Failures:** No mention of closest accessible transit, no taxi drop-off info, inaccurate distances.
- **Goal:** Detail the journey from public or private transport to the building's boundary.

### 3. Arrival
Moving from the property boundary to the entrance.
- **Failures:** Narrow paths, steep gradients, loose gravel, lack of seating.
- **Goal:** Describe the surfaces and gradients leading to the doors.

### 4. Entry
Passing through the threshold.
- **Failures:** Heavy manual doors, high thresholds, intercoms at unreachable heights, locked "accessible" side doors.
- **Goal:** Document the door type, weight, and any assistance required.

### 5. Navigation
Moving within the building.
- **Failures:** Broken lifts, narrow corridors, temporary displays blocking routes, lack of clear signage.
- **Goal:** Provide clear path widths and lift dimensions.

### 6. Participation
Engaging with the building's purpose (exhibits, service counters, programs).
- **Failures:** High counters, inaccessible seating, lack of assistive listening, no tactile options.
- **Goal:** Detail how services and programs are made accessible.

### 7. Facilities Use
Using essential services.
- **Failures:** Inaccessible toilets, no quiet space, lack of water bowls for assistance dogs.
- **Goal:** Detailed specifications of toilets, Changing Places, and seating.

### 8. Exit
Leaving the building safely, including in emergencies.
- **Failures:** Emergency exits with stairs only, no evacuation plan for disabled visitors.
- **Goal:** document the exit path and emergency procedures.

## Maintenance Risks: Where the Chain Breaks

The Access Chain is most vulnerable to **maintenance failure**. A perfectly designed building can become inaccessible in minutes:

- **The Blocked Route:** Storing boxes in corridors or placing temporary signs in the path.
- **The Broken Lift:** Lifts out of service without a public alert or alternative plan.
- **The Locked Door:** Staff locking the "alternate accessible entrance" for "security reasons."
- **The Temporary Exhibit:** New displays that don't consider wheelchair turning circles or cane-detection.

**A good access guide documents not just the architecture, but the operational commitment to keep the chain intact.**

# Building Layout and Maps

For many visitors, especially those with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities, understanding the layout of a building before they arrive is essential for a successful visit.

## Why Maps and Layouts Matter
A map isn't just a picture; it's a tool for planning. Visitors need to know:
- Which levels are accessible and how to move between them.
- Where key facilities (accessible toilets, quiet rooms, lifts) are located in relation to where they enter.
- The "flow" of the building to avoid dead-ends or overwhelming spaces.

## Best Practices for Digital Maps

### 1. Simplify and Focus
Don't just upload a complex architectural floor plan. Create a simplified version that highlights:
- **Accessible Routes:** CLEAR paths that avoid stairs or heavy manual doors.
- **Key Points of Interest:** Toilets, elevators, seating areas, and reception.
- **Step-Free Access:** Clearly mark which entrances and areas are level or ramped.

### 2. Multi-Level Support
If your building has multiple floors, provide a way to switch between levels.
- **Level Descriptions:** Use clear, consistent names (e.g., "Level 0 / Ground Floor").
- **Vertical Circulation:** Explicitly show where the lifts and accessible stairs are.

### 3. Machine-Readability and Alt-Text
Maps are highly visual. You MUST provide a text-based alternative.
- **Tactile Maps:** State if you have physical tactile maps available at reception for blind or low-vision visitors.
- **Detailed Alt-Text:** Describe the layout in words: "The ground floor contains the cafe to the left of the entrance and the accessible toilets at the far end of the main corridor."

## Interactive vs. Static
- **Static Images:** High-contrast, scalable SVG or high-resolution PNG files.
- **Interactive Maps:** If using interactive maps (like Mapbox or Google Maps indoors), ensure they are keyboard-navigable and compatible with screen readers.

> **Sensory Mapping:** Consider adding a "Quiet/Busy" overlay to your map to help neurodivergent visitors identify areas with high sensory input.

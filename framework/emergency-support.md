# Emergency Support and Service Access

In an emergency, accessibility can be the difference between safety and exclusion. Communicating your emergency protocols is as critical as describing your primary entrance.

## ICT and Emergency Services (EN 301 549)

The European standard **EN 301 549** (Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services) includes specific requirements for how emergency services must be accessible. For a building operator, this means ensuring that the *communication* of emergency help is accessible.

### Key Considerations for Your Guide:
1. **Two-Way Communication:** Does your building have emergency call points (e.g., in lifts or refuge areas)? Are they accessible to people who are d/Deaf or have speech impairments (e.g., visual confirmation of the call being received)?
2. **Real-Time Text (RTT) / SMS:** If you have an internal emergency number, can visitors text it or use RTT if they cannot make a voice call?
3. **Assistance Request:** Clearly state how a visitor can request a **Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP)** or where they should go in the event of an alarm.

## Physical Emergency Infrastructure

When describing your facilities, always include:

### 1. Refuge Areas
- **Locations:** Where are the designated safe areas for wheelchair users during an evacuation?
- **Communication:** Are there intercoms in these areas? Do they have inductive loops for hearing aid users?

### 2. Evacuation Equipment
- **Evac Chairs:** Do you have evacuation chairs? Where are they located, and are staff trained to use them?
- **Lifts:** If you have an evacuation lift (one that can be used during a fire), state this clearly and provide its location.

### 3. Accessible Alarms
- **Visual Alarms:** Do your fire alarms include visual beacons (flashing lights) in quiet areas like toilets, changing rooms, or individual offices?
- **Vibrating Pagers:** Do you offer vibrating pagers for visitors who might not hear the audible alarm?

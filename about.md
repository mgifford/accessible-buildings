# About the Building Access Guide Toolkit

The Building Access Guide Toolkit exists to help organizations publish high-quality, practical information about the physical accessibility of buildings.

## The Problem
Many organizations publish accessibility information that is either generic ("we are inclusive"), strictly legal ("we are ADA compliant"), or marketing-focused. This rarely provides the specific, operational details that disabled visitors need to plan a visit.

## Our Approach
This toolkit is built on the concept of the **Access Chain**. Access is not a single feature (like a ramp); it is a sequence of events. If any link in the chain fails—from planning the trip to entering the building and using the facilities—the whole visit may fail.

### Core Goals:
1. **Practicality:** Provide templates that can be copy-pasted and filled out.
2. **Transparency:** Encourage organizations to state what is **not** accessible, as well as what is.
3. **Structured Data:** Move towards a future where accessibility information is machine-readable and discoverable by search engines.
4. **Resilience:** Include maintenance checklists to ensure accessibility doesn't degrade over time.

## Neutrality
This toolkit is intentionally neutral. While it incorporates best practices from around the world (including the DOJ museum guidance and Sensory Trust frameworks), it is designed to be applicable to any building type: museums, libraries, offices, schools, and civic buildings.

# Australian Government – Building Accessibility Guide

## Purpose of This Canonical Summary

This document preserves and translates the Australian Government Department of Finance guidance on creating a **Building Accessibility Guide**.

The original guidance provides a structured model for publishing visitor-facing information about the accessibility of government buildings.

This summary:

- Extracts the structural publishing model.
- Generalizes beyond Australian federal buildings.
- Maps content expectations to this toolkit’s templates.
- Does not reproduce the original text verbatim.

---

# Core Contribution

The Australian Government guidance formalizes something many institutions fail to do:

Publish a clear, structured, public-facing Building Accessibility Guide that enables visitors to understand:

- How to get to the building.
- How to enter it.
- How to move within it.
- What facilities exist.
- What assistance is available.
- What limitations exist.

It treats accessibility information as an operational publication requirement, not informal marketing copy.

---

# Structural Model Extracted

The guidance implies a consistent structure, which can be generalized as follows:

1. Overview and purpose
2. Getting to the building
3. Entering the building
4. Moving around inside
5. Facilities
6. Assistance and communication supports
7. Contact information

This structure aligns closely with the Access Chain model.

---

# 1. Overview Section

The Building Accessibility Guide should begin with:

- The purpose of the document.
- A statement that it provides information to assist visitors with disability.
- A brief summary of major accessibility features.

Toolkit Implication:

Templates must include a “Quick Summary” section that highlights:

- Step-free entrance
- Accessible toilets
- Accessible parking
- Lifts
- Hearing loops
- Quiet spaces
- Known constraints

This prevents users from needing to scan an entire document for critical information.

---

# 2. Getting to the Building

The guidance emphasizes describing access before arrival.

This typically includes:

- Public transport options
- Drop-off points
- Parking arrangements
- Accessible parking bays
- Path of travel from parking or transit to entrance

Toolkit Expansion:

Arrival must include:

- Mode-by-mode breakdown (bus, train, taxi, cycling, driving).
- Distances in meters.
- Surface conditions.
- Kerb cuts and crossings.
- Gradients where relevant.
- Step-free confirmation.

Access information must not assume car travel only.

---

# 3. Entering the Building

The guidance expects clarity around:

- Main entrance accessibility.
- Alternative accessible entrances (if applicable).
- Security procedures.
- Reception desk access.

Toolkit Expansion:

Templates must require:

- Door type (automatic/manual/revolving).
- Threshold condition.
- Intercom availability.
- What to do if main entrance is not step-free.
- Clear instructions if an alternative entrance is required.

If alternate entrance use is required, it must not be described vaguely.

---

# 4. Moving Around Inside

The guidance addresses:

- Accessible routes.
- Lifts and floor access.
- Corridors and circulation areas.
- Signage.
- Wayfinding.

Toolkit Expansion:

Templates must include:

- Floors served by lift.
- Lift location.
- Whether staff escort is required.
- Known narrow areas.
- Temporary reconfiguration risks.
- Clear route signage description.

The guide must describe how visitors move through the building, not simply state compliance.

---

# 5. Facilities

The Australian model expects explicit disclosure of:

- Accessible toilets.
- Parenting facilities.
- Waiting areas.
- Seating.
- Service counters.
- Emergency procedures.

Toolkit Expansion:

Facilities section must include:

- Accessible toilet location.
- Changing Places facilities (if applicable).
- Transfer space notes if known.
- Seating availability and type.
- Counter heights or lowered counter availability.
- Shop or café accessibility (if present).

Facilities must not be excluded because they are “secondary spaces.”

---

# 6. Assistance and Communication Supports

The guidance expects publication of:

- Hearing loops.
- Interpreting services (if available).
- Assistive listening.
- Communication supports.
- How to request accommodations.

Toolkit Expansion:

Access Guide must specify:

- Advance notice requirements.
- On-site assistance procedures.
- Contact details.
- Staff training expectations.
- Availability of alternate formats.

This moves from passive disclosure to active usability.

---

# 7. Contact Information

The Building Accessibility Guide must include:

- A direct contact for accessibility inquiries.
- Phone and email.
- Hours monitored.
- Instructions for advance arrangements.

Toolkit Expansion:

Templates must require:

- A named role or team responsible.
- Response time expectation.
- Escalation pathway if unresolved.

Accessibility without accountability is unreliable.

---

# Structural Insights

The Australian guidance does something important:

It formalizes accessibility disclosure as a standard operational publication.

It does not treat accessibility as:

- An optional marketing page.
- A legal disclaimer.
- A PDF appendix.
- A static compliance claim.

It treats it as practical visitor planning information.

---

# Generalization Beyond Australian Federal Buildings

Although written for Australian government properties, the structural expectations apply equally to:

- Local government buildings
- Museums and galleries
- Libraries
- Universities
- Community centers
- Event venues
- Corporate offices open to the public

Replace regulatory references with applicable local law as needed.

The publishing model remains valid.

---

# Relationship to This Toolkit

This canonical summary informs:

- `/templates/building-access-guide.md`
- `/templates/summary-template.md`
- `/templates/arrival-template.md`
- `/website-placement.md`
- `/governance.md`

It is the clearest example of a government-level publishing standard for building accessibility information.

---

# What Has Been Omitted

This summary does not reproduce:

- Australian regulatory references.
- Legislative citations.
- Design standards.
- Complete narrative guidance.
- Example building text.

It preserves the publishing structure and operational implications only.

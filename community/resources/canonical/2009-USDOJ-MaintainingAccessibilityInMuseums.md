# 2009 – U.S. DOJ – Maintaining Accessibility in Museums

## Purpose of This Canonical Summary

This document preserves and translates the operational guidance from the 2009 DOJ publication *Maintaining Accessibility in Museums* into structured, implementation-oriented guidance for this toolkit.

The original document focuses on maintaining accessibility under the ADA in museum environments  [oai_citation:0‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c).

This summary:
- Extracts structural maintenance categories.
- Generalizes museum-specific language to apply to all public buildings.
- Maps operational risks to the Access Chain model.
- Identifies implications for publishing building access information.

This is not a full reproduction of the original document.

# Core Principle

Accessibility is not achieved once.  
It must be maintained.

Physical features, programmatic accommodations, and communication supports degrade over time due to:

- Temporary events
- Renovations
- Equipment failures
- Staff turnover
- Poor monitoring
- Merchandising or space reconfiguration

The key contribution of the DOJ guidance is operational vigilance  [oai_citation:1‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c).

---

# Structural Categories Extracted from the DOJ Guidance

The original guidance identifies three major maintenance domains:

1. Building Features
2. Programs and Communication
3. Retail/Shop Areas

These map directly to this toolkit’s:

- Access Chain model
- Maintenance checklist template
- Building Access Guide template

---

# 1. Building Features

## 1.1 Accessible Entrances

Operational risks identified in the DOJ guidance  [oai_citation:2‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c):

- Accessible entrances are not the main entrance.
- Alternate entrances are locked during events.
- Gates or pathways along accessible routes are closed.
- Snow, debris, or landscaping blocks access.
- Power-operated doors are turned off.
- No staff available to assist when automatic doors fail.
- Inadequate signage directing to accessible entrances.

### Toolkit Implications

Building access pages must specify:

- Whether the main entrance is step-free.
- If alternate entrances exist and when to use them.
- What to do if powered doors are not operating.
- Whether the accessible route is weather dependent.
- How to request assistance if entry fails.

Maintenance checklist must include:

- Daily route inspection.
- Powered door functionality verification.
- Signage verification at inaccessible entrances.

---

## 1.2 Accessible Routes Throughout the Building

The DOJ guidance highlights several maintenance risks  [oai_citation:3‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c):

- Temporary exhibitions blocking routes.
- Stanchions narrowing passage width.
- Movable seating blocking access.
- Roped-off areas eliminating step-free paths.
- Directional signage moved or missing.
- Objects protruding between 27 and 80 inches above floor (cane-detectable hazard zone).
- Clearance width violations (36 inches typical minimum).

### Toolkit Implications

Building Access Guide must include:

- Whether routes are subject to temporary reconfiguration.
- How alternate routes are communicated.
- Lift dependency for certain areas.
- Known narrow passages.
- Potential sensory or congestion risks.

Maintenance checklist must include:

- Route width checks.
- Cane-detectable hazard checks.
- Temporary installation review before opening.
- Clear signage at route decision points.

---

## 1.3 Elevators

The DOJ guidance states that elevators serving public areas must remain operable  [oai_citation:4‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c).

Risks include:

- Elevator downtime with no alternative plan.
- Non-public elevators used without clear instructions.
- Failure to provide alternative access if lift unavailable.

### Toolkit Implications

Access Guide must state:

- Which floors are lift-dependent.
- What happens if lift is out of service.
- Whether an alternate entrance or presentation is available.
- How visitors are informed of outages.

Maintenance checklist must include:

- Lift testing schedule.
- Outage communication protocol.
- Temporary mitigation planning.

---

# 2. Programs and Communication

The DOJ guidance extends beyond physical infrastructure  [oai_citation:5‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c).

## 2.1 Staff Knowledge

Risks:

- Front desk staff unaware of accessibility services.
- Volunteers unable to explain how to request accommodations.
- Staff unfamiliar with relay services.

### Toolkit Implications

Access Guide must include:

- Clear contact for access support.
- Advance request procedures.
- On-site assistance availability.

Maintenance checklist must include:

- Staff training schedule.
- Volunteer onboarding accessibility module.
- Accessibility contact documentation.

---

## 2.2 Auxiliary Aids and Services

Examples from the DOJ guidance  [oai_citation:6‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c):

- Assistive listening devices.
- Captioning controls.
- Audio description tours.
- Alternate format materials.
- Tactile objects.

Risks:

- Equipment not tested.
- Materials outdated.
- Tactile objects removed without replacement.

### Toolkit Implications

Building Access Guide must specify:

- What assistive devices are available.
- Whether captioning is standard.
- Whether tactile alternatives exist.
- How to request them.

Maintenance checklist must include:

- Regular equipment testing.
- Inventory tracking.
- Simultaneous release of alternate formats with standard materials.

---

## 2.3 Website Accessibility

The DOJ guidance states that museum websites should be accessible and kept current  [oai_citation:7‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c).

Toolkit interpretation:

Physical access transparency must:

- Be HTML-first.
- Be searchable.
- Be accessible to screen readers.
- Be maintained in sync with physical changes.

This is directly relevant to this repository’s WCAG requirements.

---

# 3. Retail and Ancillary Areas

The DOJ guidance includes museum shops  [oai_citation:8‡museum_access.pdf](sediment://file_000000007810722faeba687abcb4858c).

Risks:

- Merchandise narrowing aisles.
- Counters obstructed.
- Staff unaware of how to assist.

Toolkit generalization:

Any public-facing space (café, shop, ticket desk) must be:

- Included in access description.
- Routinely monitored for obstruction.
- Included in maintenance checklist.

---

# Access Chain Mapping

The DOJ guidance primarily addresses the middle of the Access Chain:

- Entry
- Internal navigation
- Participation
- Facilities

It does not deeply address:
- Travel planning
- External transit routes

Toolkit expands the scope beyond the DOJ document.

---

# Generalization Beyond Museums

Although written for museums, the operational risks apply equally to:

- Civic buildings
- Libraries
- Universities
- Offices
- Community centers
- Healthcare facilities
- Event venues

Replace:
“Exhibition” with “temporary installation”
“Gallery” with “public area”
“Shop” with “retail or service area”

The structural risks remain identical.

---

# What Has Been Omitted

This summary does not reproduce:

- Census statistics.
- Historical background.
- Full legal coverage explanations.
- Complete verbatim text.
- Specific numeric ADA citations beyond illustrative references.

This file preserves structure and operational implications, not legal instruction.

---

# Relationship to Toolkit Templates

This canonical summary directly informs:

- `/templates/building-access-guide.md`
- `/templates/maintenance-checklist.md`
- `/access-chain.md`
- `/governance.md`

Any future changes to those templates must remain consistent with these structural categories.

# Contributing to the Building Access Guide

This Building Access Guide is a community-driven project that pulls together ideas from accessibility experts and published guides from across the web. To keep it evolving, we rely on your feedback and contributions.

## Engagement via GitHub

We use GitHub as our primary space for collaboration. We encourage everyone to engage with us through:

1. **GitHub Issues:** Use issues to report broken links, suggest content improvements, or ask for clarifications. It's the best way to ensure your feedback is tracked and addressed.
2. **Pull Requests:** If you have specific changes to templates or guidance, feel free to fork the repository and submit a PR.

## How You Can Help

### 1. Add Examples
Help us build a library of high-quality access guides. If you know of a building with an excellent guide, or if you've developed one using these templates, please add it to our examples.

### 2. Improve Templates
If you find gaps in our templates (especially in critical areas like washrooms or sensory navigation), please share your expertise.

### 3. Technical Improvements
Help us improve the Jekyll structure, CSS contrast, or structured data (Schema.org) implementations.

## Guidelines

- **Neutral Tone:** Avoid marketing or legalistic language.
- **Task-Based:** Focus on actionable information for visitors.
- **Accessible:** All contributions must meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards.

Thank you for helping make the world more accessible!

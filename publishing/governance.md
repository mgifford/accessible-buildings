# Governance: Keeping Information Accurate

Buildings change. Lifts break. Exhibits move. Accessibility information is only valuable if it is accurate.

## Who Owns the Access Page?

A single department or role should be designated as the "owner" of the building access information. This is typically:
- Facilities Management
- Visitor Services
- Operations Manager

## Update Frequency

At a minimum, access information should be reviewed and verified **annually**.

## Review Triggers

Certain events must trigger an immediate review of the accessibility information:

1. **Renovations:** Any structural changes to entrances, paths, or facilities.
2. **Exhibit/Layout Changes:** New temporary walls, displays, or furniture that might narrow a path.
3. **Maintenance Failures:** If a lift or power door will be out of service for more than 24 hours, the website should be updated with a temporary alert.
4. **Service Changes:** Changes to staff training, assistance dog policies, or opening hours.

## Policy: The Public Change Log

Transparency builds trust. We recommend maintaining a small "Last Updated" section or a public change log on your access page:

| Date | Description of Change |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2024-05-10 | Updated lift dimensions after replacement. |
| 2024-02-15 | Added information about new quiet space on Level 2. |
| 2023-11-20 | Annual full review and verification. |

## Versioning

For large organizations, keep internal versions of your access guides so you can track how the building's accessibility has evolved over time.

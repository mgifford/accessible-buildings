# Where Should Your Access Info Live?

The best building access guide is useless if visitors cannot find it. Accessibility information should be integrated into the natural flow of your website.

## Required Placement

Don't bury your accessibility page in a sub-menu. It must be visible from these key locations:

1. **The Global Footer:** A clear "Accessibility" or "Access Guide" link in the footer of every page.
2. **Contact Page:** Provide access info alongside your address and phone number.
3. **Visit / Plan Your Visit Pages:** This is where visitors look for logistical info.
4. **Event Pages:** Every event listing should link back to the building's access details.

## Recommended URL Patterns

Consistent URL patterns help users and search engines find your information quickly. We recommend:

- `/visit/access/`
- `/access-guide/`
- `/venue-access/`
- `/building-accessibility/`

## Anti-Patterns: What to Avoid

- **PDF-Only:** Never make a PDF the primary source of info. It's hard to read on mobile and often not accessible to screen readers.
- **Marketing Language:** Avoid "we welcome everyone" without follows up with "our doors are 90cm wide."
- **Vague Compliance Claims:** Stating "ADA Compliant" or "Standard Compliant" tells a visitor nothing about their specific needs.
- **Hidden Behind Forms:** Never require a user to log in or fill out a form to see access information.

## Cross-Linking Strategy

Ensure that your Access Guide links **out** to relevant pages (like booking tickets for accessible seats) and that those pages link **back** to the Access Guide.

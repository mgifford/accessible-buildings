# Accessibility Statement for Building Access Guide

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this toolkit. This website is designed to be accessible to all users, regardless of ability.

## Conformance Goal
Our goal is to meet the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 at Level AA**.

## How We Test
To ensure we meet these standards, we use a combination of automated and manual testing methods:
- **Automated Testing:** We run `pa11y-ci` with the `axe-core` engine on every change via GitHub Actions.
- **Manual Testing:** We perform periodic manual reviews, including keyboard-only navigation and screen reader testing.
- **Link Integrity:** We use automated link checkers to ensure all content is reachable.

## Known Constraints
While we strive for perfection, we are a community-driven project. Some aspects of the site (like third-party theme components) may occasionally fall short. We prioritize fixing these issues whenever they are identified.

## Reporting Problems
If you find any accessibility barriers or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know. We use **GitHub Issues** as our primary engagement and reporting tool.

- **[Report an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mgifford/accessible-buildings/issues/new)**
- **[View Existing Issues](https://github.com/mgifford/accessible-buildings/issues)**

We aim to respond to all accessibility-related issues within 7 business days.

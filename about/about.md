# About the Building Access Guide

The Building Access Guide exists to help organizations communicate high-quality, practical information about the physical accessibility of their buildings on their websites.

## Communication vs. Construction

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **communication framework**. It helps you describe what already exists. It is **not** a guide on how to build or renovate an accessible building.
>
> For instructions on physical construction, accessibility standards, or building codes, you should refer to your local regulations (such as the ADA in the US, Part M in the UK, or the AODA in Ontario) and accessibility consultants.

## Our Approach
This framework is built on the concept of the **Access Chain**. Access is not a single feature (like a ramp); it is a sequence of events. If any link in the chain fails—from planning the trip to entering the building and using the facilities—the whole visit may fail.

### Core Goals:
1. **Practicality:** Provide templates that can be copy-pasted into your website CMS.
2. **Transparency:** Encourage organizations to state what is **not** accessible, as well as what is.
3. **Structured Data:** Move towards a future where accessibility information is machine-readable and discoverable by search engines.
4. **Resilience:** Include maintenance checklists to ensure the *information* and the *physical link* stay accurate over time.

## Neutrality and Expertise
This toolkit is intentionally neutral and community-driven. It pulls together established best practices, research, and documentation patterns from accessibility experts and published guides across the web.

Key influences include:
- **Museum Accessibility Guidance:** Models for describing operational constraints in complex public buildings.
- **The Access Chain:** A sequential framework for understanding user journeys.
- **Web Standards:** Applying WCAG-style rigor to physical documentation.

While we strive for international applicability, we encourage users to adapt these templates to their local regulatory context and specific building types.

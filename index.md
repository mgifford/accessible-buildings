# Build Better Building Access Guides

A practical framework for publishing structured, transparent information about the physical accessibility of buildings.

## The Mission
Accessibility information should be **practical**, **sequential**, and **honest**. This toolkit provides everything you need to describe your building in a way that helps disabled visitors plan their journey with confidence.

### [Templates]({{ "/templates/" | relative_url }})
Download ready-to-use, copy-paste templates for full access guides, sensory profiles, and maintenance checklists.

### [Website Placement]({{ "/website-placement/" | relative_url }})
Guidance on where and how to link your access information to ensure it reaches those who need it.

### [Examples]({{ "/examples/" | relative_url }})
See how other organizations are using this toolkit to improve their transparency.

### [Governance]({{ "/governance/" | relative_url }})
How to own, update, and maintain your accessibility information for long-term accuracy.

## Why "Access Chain"?
Access isn't a ramp. It's a sequence. If any link in the chain fails—a broken lift, a blocked hallway, or a hidden entrance—the whole visit fails. This toolkit helps you audit and document every link.

# Contributing to the Toolkit

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve the quality and reach of building accessibility information.

## How You Can Help

### 1. Add Examples
Help us build a library of high-quality access guides. If you know of a building with an excellent guide, or if you've developed one using these templates, please add it to the `_examples` collection.

### 2. Improve Templates
If you find gaps in our templates or have suggestions for better wording or structure, please let us know.

### 3. Translation
We aim to be globally applicable. Help us translate templates and guidance into other languages.

### 4. Technical Improvements
Help us improve the Jekyll structure, CSS, or structured data implementations.

## Our Process

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the toolkit.
2. **Create a Branch:** Work on your changes in a dedicated branch.
3. **Submit a Pull Request:** Describe your changes and why they are needed.
4. **Review:** Maintainers will review your contribution for alignment with our core principles.

## Guidelines

- **Neutral Tone:** Avoid marketing or legalistic language.
- **Task-Based:** Focus on actionable information for visitors.
- **Structured:** Use clear headings and lists.
- **Accessible:** All contributions must meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards.

Thank you for helping make the world more accessible!

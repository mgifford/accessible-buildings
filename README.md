# Building Access Guide Toolkit

A practical framework for publishing structured, transparent physical accessibility information for buildings.

## Purpose

The Building Access Guide Toolkit helps organizations provide the specific, operational details that disabled visitors need to plan a visit with confidence. It focuses on the **Access Chain**—the sequential journey from travel to navigation and use of facilities.

## Core Principles

- **Task-based:** Answers "Can I get there and use the place?"
- **Sequential:** Follows the visitor journey (the Access Chain).
- **Maintenance-aware:** Documents how accessibility fails when routines break.
- **Machine-readable:** Structured for search and automated discovery.
- **HTML-first:** Prioritizes accessible web content over PDFs.

## How to Use This Toolkit

1. **Pick a Template:** Use the [templates](./templates/) to build your access guide.
2. **Review the Access Chain:** Ensure your content covers every link in the journey.
3. **Internal Governance:** Use the [maintenance checklist](./templates/maintenance-checklist.md) to keep information accurate.
4. **Placement:** Follow the [website placement guidance](./website-placement.md) to make sure visitors can find your information.
